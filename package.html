QCDBAccess is a free, open source, thread safe, SQLite database wrapper for Java available under the <b>BSD license</b>.  You may use it for open or closed source applications.  You may 
give your application away free or charge for it.  The BSD license has no restrictions regarding these topics.  This library is included in the QuickConnect Android application template.

The DataAccessObject class contains the methods used to interact with an SQLite database file included in your Android applications' assets directory.
<br/>
<br/>
QCDBAccess fully supports database transactions including roll backs.  It is also thread safe.  Any number of threads may make database modifications, insertions, queries, etc. without corrupting the database.
<br/><br/>
I have attempted to make this library as easy to use, small, and fast as I could.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
